    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>A little happy sunlight shining through there. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. The light is your friend. Preserve it. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.</p>

    <p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Get tough with it, get strong. Use your imagination, let it go. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>

    <p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

    <p>That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Anyone can paint. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Those great big fluffy clouds.</p>

    <p>Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?</p>

    <p>Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Let's get crazy. The least little bit can do so much.</p>

    <p>Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.</p>
